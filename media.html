        <p>The life of a movie and TV aficionado is kind of hard, if you think about it.  Say that there’s a blockbuster movie that you want to see.  Do you go see it in theatres as soon as it comes out?  That will cost you a pretty penny.  Do you wait until the movie has a physical release, and then buy it?  It’s still kind of expensive, there’s no telling if you’ll even watch the movie more than once, and the player (or disc) may stop working or become obsolete.</p>
        <h2>So what is Netflix, in a nutshell?</h2>
        <p>Netflix is a website that allows you to watch movies and television shows whenever you want and as often as you want.  A monthly subscription gives you access to all titles available on Netflix for your country, which you can watch on your computer, mobile device, smart TV, or other digital media player.

            Netflix is a media streaming service.  What this means is that you can watch a movie or TV show episode as the file is loading, as opposed to having to wait for the entire file to load before you can begin watching</p>
